Here are two ways to get in touch with the *nordlicht* project:

## Twitter

To get status updates, follow [@libnordlicht](https://twitter.com/libnordlicht). You're also welcome to request the nordlicht of your favorite movie! :-)

The account [@nordlichtbot](https://twitter.com/nordlichtbot) automatically posts example images periodically. It's part experimentation platform, part continuous integration testing!

## GitHub

We use GitHub for all forms of discussion. If you find bugs, need help, or have any suggestions, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/nordlicht/nordlicht/issues/new) in *nordlicht*'s issue tracker.

## Email

If you absolutely need to keep something private, you can [contact Sebastian](https://morr.cc/about/) by mail.
